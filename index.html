              She had an exceptional skill in the therapeutic environment using knowledge, empathy, patience, and focused engagement. Together, she helped me untie complicated, knotted layers of past events and link them to present anxieties and vice versa, leading towards a restoration of my well-being.

            <p>
              I saw Jennifer Du once a week for nine months following a short series of first-ever panic attacks, coupled to a profound growing sense of anxiety, intermingled with a depressive loss of self-confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a long professional career and, at times, a trauma-laden personal life, and following my doctor's advice, I sought therapy to help me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jennifer Du was my choice, and I found in her a gifted therapist who supported me back to health in a way I did not fully expect and for which I will always be grateful. That is why I do not hesitate to recommend to others her work, methods, manner, and insights which helped me so much.
            </p>
            <p>
              She had an exceptional skill in the therapeutic environment using knowledge, empathy, patience, and focussed engagement. I trusted her and her work the more I spent in therapy with her. Together, she helped me untie complicated, knotted layers of past events and link them to present anxieties and vice versa. Together, she helped me unravel, reveal, and then release unexplored parts of my life story. This led to a reduction of symptoms and then later to a restoration of my well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
              She showed me, furthermore, how to handle worry and anxiety, including how to face new stages in my life. All accomplished in a kind, thoughtful and supportive atmosphere.

              I have had experience with other therapists before Jennifer, I was never able to commit - I used to feel judged, unsafe and stressed talking to therapist. But it was different with Jennifer, she made me feel safe and held. Even in the difficult conversations, I can see and feel the softness and empathy in her intentions.

              I have been seeing Jennifer since January 2025, when I had my first burn out that led to a total physical and mental collapse.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              With Jennifer's help, I was able to look further inwards and am trying to rebuild the relationship with myself - Jennifer held a mirror for me to see the real me. It was messy, unfamiliar, but more objective, one step closer to my truth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jennifer also has fun and innovative ways to convey her messages - she often draws, sometimes diagrams, other times metaphorical images, to visualise and to help me understand her points, it works really well for me personally, I process images far efficiently than I do abstract concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've also witnessed the adaptation in Jennifer's approach, it became more tailored to my needs as our relationship developed. Considering my improvements, I would recommend Jennifer.

          <h3>How do you work?</h3>
          <p>
            I offer a relational, person-centred approach. Rather than following a set programme, I stay close to what you bring, trusting that understanding and change grow through being listened to carefully.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item" id="faq-frequency">
          <h3>How often will I need to come to therapy?</h3>
          <p>
            Most people come weekly. We can adjust frequency based on your needs.

        <div class="faq-item" id="faq-session">
          <h3>What happens in a psychotherapy session?</h3>
          <p>
            Sessions are 50 minutes in a confidential space. You bring whatever feels important — concerns, relationships, memories, or difficult feelings. There's no pressure to talk in a particular way.
          </p>

        <div class="faq-item" id="faq-regulated">
          <h3>Are you regulated by a professional body?</h3>

            Yes. I am registered with UKCP and BACP, working in line with their ethical frameworks including confidentiality, professional boundaries, and data protection (CID registered).

        <div class="faq-item" id="faq-supervision">
          <h3>What supervision do you undertake?</h3>

            I attend fortnightly clinical supervision to ensure safe, ethical practice.

          <h3>How do you maintain your professional development?</h3>
